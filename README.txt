Freebies: UCI Community Engagement application

The concept behind this app is to create a community engagement 
application where we gather up all the emails school send and 
put it in a format that is easily consumed and searchable by the user.


**Some of the features in this app uses a free trial for the database
so it might not completely work after April 7th, 2018
